Abstract

This document outlines a MapReduce program designed to filter and analyze data for laptops produced by the brand MSI. The objective is to identify the most notable MSI laptops based on specific criteria: only those with a screen size greater than 15 inches and a rating above 4. The program will process a dataset containing various laptop specifications, applying the MapReduce paradigm to efficiently handle large volumes of data. 

The Map phase will involve extracting relevant attributes from the dataset, such as screen size and rating, while the Reduce phase will aggregate results to produce a filtered list of high-performance, highly-rated MSI laptops. This program aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making for consumers and stakeholders interested in high-quality MSI laptops. 

The expected output will be a concise list of laptops that meet the defined criteria, providing insights into the top-performing products in MSI's lineup.
